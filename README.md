<h4 align="left">The development of this web application was made using technologies such as React, Redux, Node and Sequelize. I developed the server side (Back End) of the application in Node.JS using Express, consuming data from an API and combining it with the information entered by the client, implementing a database using PostgresSQL with Sequalize, as well as the client side (Front End) using React and Redux for application state management.</h4>
